<h3>Ragnar the Red - Malukah</h3>
<div id="lyrics">
Oh, there once was a hero named Ragnar the Red<br>
Who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead<br>
And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade<br>
As he told of bold battles and gold he had made<br>
But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red<br>
When he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said<br>
Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead<br>
Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed<br>
And so then came clashing and slashing of steel<br>
As the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal<br>
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no more<br>
When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor<br>
And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no more<br>
When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor<br>
